# üëã Welcome

Owlbear is a VS Code extension aiming to bring the [paredit-like structural editing](https://calva.io/paredit/) paradigm, commonly enjoyed when working with Lisps, to the mainstream! Currently, Owlbear supports HTML, TypeScript, TypeScript-React (TSX), JavaScript, and JavaScript-React (JSX) languages.

Try Owlbear without installing it first in Gitpod!

## Installation

Install the extension by searching for `Owlbear` in the [Visual Studio Code Extension Pane](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace), then click **install**.

It's also recommended that you install the [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) extension as it *pairs* nicely with Owlbear.
