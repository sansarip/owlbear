# Owlbear

A better way to wrangle tags in VS Code!

Owlbear supports [paredit](https://github.com/sansarip/owlbear/wiki/Glossary#par-edit)-like structural-editing features for HTML, TypeScript, TypeScript-React, JavaScript, and JavaScript-React!

After installing the extension, simply execute `cmd+shift+p` in VS Code and search for `Owlbear` to get started!

And, for more details, view the [docs page](https://sansarip.github.io/owlbear)!


You can also try Owlbear without installing it, in <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sansarip/owlbear">Gitpod</a>.
